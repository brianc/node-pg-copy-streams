## pg-copy-streams

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-pg-copy-streams.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-pg-copy-streams)

COPY FROM / COPY TO for node-postgres.  Stream from one database to another, and stuff.

## how? what? huh?

Did you know the _all powerful_ PostgreSQL supports streaming binary data directly into and out of a table?
This means you can take your favorite CSV or TSV or whatever format file and pipe it directly into an existing PostgreSQL table.
You can also take a table and pipe it directly to a file, another database, stdout, even to `/dev/null` if you're crazy!

What this module gives you is a [Readable](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) or [Writable](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable) stream directly into/out of a table in your database.
This mode of interfacing with your table is _very fast_ and _very brittle_.  You are responsible for properly encoding and ordering all your columns. If anything is out of place PostgreSQL will send you back an error.  The stream works within a transaction so you wont leave things in a 1/2 borked state, but it's still good to be aware of.

If you're not familiar with the feature (I wasn't either) you can read this for some good helps: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-copy.html

## examples

### pipe from a table to stdout

```js
var pg = require('pg');
var copyTo = require('pg-copy-streams').to;

pg.connect(function(err, client, done) {
  var stream = client.query(copyTo('COPY my_table TO STDOUT'));
  stream.pipe(process.stdout);
  stream.on('end', done);
  stream.on('error', done);
});
```

### pipe from a file to table

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var pg = require('pg');
var copyFrom = require('pg-copy-streams').from;

pg.connect(function(err, client, done) {
  var stream = client.query(copyFrom('COPY my_table FROM STDIN'));
  var fileStream = fs.createReadStream('some_file.tdv')
  
  fileStream.pipe(stream);
  fileStream.on('end', done)
  fileStream.on('error', done);
});
```

## install

```sh
$ npm install pg-copy-streams
```

## notice

This module __only__ works with the pure JavaScript bindings.  If you're using `require('pg').native` please make sure to use normal `require('pg')` or `require('pg.js')` when you're using copy streams.

Before you set out on this magical piping journey, you _really_ should read this: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-copy.html, and you might want to take a look at the [tests](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-copy-streams/tree/master/test) to get an idea of how things work.

## contributing

Instead of adding a bunch more code to the already bloated [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) I am trying to make the internals extensible and work on adding edge-case features as 3rd party modules.
This is one of those.

Please, if you have any issues with this, open an issue.

Better yet, submit a pull request.  I _love_ pull requests.

Generally how I work is if you submit a few pull requests and you're interested I'll make you a contributor and give you full access to everything.

Since this isn't a module with tons of installs and dependent modules I hope we can work together on this to iterate faster here and make something really useful.
